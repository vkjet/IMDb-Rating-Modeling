# IMDb Rating modeling with multiple linear regression

*Author: Valeriy Kondruk*

## Research question: Without watching a movie, can we say whether the audience loves it?

Obviously, the popularity of a movie is mainly based on its content and the art value it offers. Those two factors are very hard if not impossible to calculate, though. However, there are certain characteristics of a movie that we can calculate and classify comparatively easy. Among others, those are genre, duration, and cast quality. Using those and other variables from the data frame, we'll create a prediction model for movie popularity among the audience.
